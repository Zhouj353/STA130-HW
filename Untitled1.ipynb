    "(a) Non-Numeric Variables\n",
    "Non-numeric variables (also known as categorical or qualitative variables) in a dataset represent data that is not naturally expressed as numbers. These variables are typically strings or categories. Common examples of non-numeric variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Names (e.g., the name of a villager)\n",
    "Categories (e.g., personality, species, or gender)\n",
    "Dates (if they are not formatted as numeric types)\n",
    "Characteristics of Non-Numeric Variables:\n",
    "Unique Values: Non-numeric variables can have multiple unique values (e.g., a \"species\" column might contain several categories like cat, dog, bird, etc.).\n",
    "No Mathematical Operations: You cannot perform mathematical operations (like addition or averaging) on these variables.\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: For non-numeric variables, the most common summary statistics include:\n",
    "Count: Number of non-null entries.\n",
    "Unique: Number of unique categories in the column.\n",
    "Top: The most frequent category.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(df.describe(include='object'))\n",

    "(b) Missing Values in Numeric Variables\n",
    "Missing values occur when certain entries are not recorded in the dataset. In pandas, missing values are typically represented as NaN (Not a Number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of Missing Values on Numeric Variables:\n",
    "Mean and Median: The mean and median calculations will ignore NaN values, but if too many values are missing, these statistics might not be meaningful.\n",
    "Summaries: When using df.describe(), the count displayed for each numeric column is the number of non-missing (non-NaN) values. Missing values are excluded from summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df.describe())\n",
    "The output will show the count of non-missing values, and statistics like mean, minimum, and maximum will only include those non-missing values.\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df.isna().sum())\n",
    "This will give you a count of missing (NaN) values per column. If some columns have missing data, you'll need to handle them (e.g., through imputation or by dropping those rows/columns).\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "Non-numeric variables: Cannot be used in calculations; common statistics include counts of unique categories and the frequency of top categories.\n",

    "what is \"attribute\" and \"method\" in python\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "In Python, both attributes and methods are part of objects, which are instances of classes. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attribute\n",
    "An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object (or instance of a class). It holds information or data about the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes define the characteristics or properties of the object.\n",
    "They are like the \"nouns\" of an object, describing what the object \"has.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",

    "print(my_car.model)  # Output: Corolla\n",
    "Here, make and model are attributes of the Car object. They hold the values \"Toyota\" and \"Corolla\", respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method\n",
    "A method is a function that is associated with an object (or instance of a class). It defines the behavior of the object‚Äîwhat the object can \"do.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside a class and are used to perform actions on or with the object.\n",

    "\n",
    "1)Use your ChatBot session to understand what df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "\n",
    "*I said:\n",
    "Use your ChatBot session to understand what df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "The expression df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"] in pandas is part of the groupby operation, which is used to group rows in a DataFrame based on the values in a column (col1) and then perform operations on another column (col2) within those groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs what happens step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. df.groupby(\"col1\")\n",
    "This groups the DataFrame (df) by unique values in the column col1.\n",
    "The result is a GroupBy object, which contains information about how the rows of the DataFrame are split based on the values in col1. However, no computation is performed at this stage.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'col1': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'C'],\n",
    "    'col2': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "})\n",
    "grouped = df.groupby('col1')\n",
    "The grouped object now represents groups based on the unique values in col1 (i.e., groups 'A', 'B', and 'C').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [\"col2\"]\n",
    "After grouping, the next part of the expression [\"col2\"] specifies that you're interested in working with only the col2 values for each group.\n",
    "At this point, you're narrowing down the operation to just one specific column (col2).\n",
    "Example (continuing from above):\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "grouped_col2 = df.groupby('col1')['col2']\n",
    "Now, grouped_col2 represents only the col2 values for each group (i.e., the numeric values corresponding to each unique col1 value).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What you can do with this?\n",
    "Once you have grouped by col1 and selected col2, you can perform aggregation or transformation operations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum the values within each group:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].sum()\n",
    "This would sum the values in col2 for each unique col1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean of values within each group:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].mean()\n",
    "This would calculate the average value of col2 for each group in col1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the number of values in each group:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].count()\n",
    "Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "Suppose you have the following DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'col1': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'C'],\n",
    "    'col2': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "})\n",
    "If you group by col1 and sum the values in col2:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].sum()\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "col1\n",
    "A    40  # (10 + 30)\n",
    "B    60  # (20 + 40)\n",
    "C    50  # (only one value)\n",
    "Name: col2, dtype: int64\n",
    "Key Takeaway:\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\"): Groups the rows of the DataFrame by unique values in col1.\n",
    "[\"col2\"]: Selects the column col2 for performing operations.\n",
    "After this, you can apply aggregation functions like sum(), mean(), count(), etc., to compute statistics within each group.\n",
    "Would you like to see more specific examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "My explaination:\n",
    "df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"] is group the same objects in col1 and add their values together in col2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, df.describe() would have different values in the count value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data. Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the count that result from doing something like df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Because it will make the values different without delet the missing values. Such as there are missing some values in the col2 and col2 will have less object than col1 and it will make the groupby function don't know what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "*ChatBot will help me fix the errors more quickly than google search. Because ChatBot is based on the data online, that means the data in google is also in the ChatBot and ChatBot combines the data from google and find my error qucikly than google search. \n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, I use ChatBot to help me understand the difficult part from the textbook. It can easily provide basic understanding for me and it can help me learn the new knowledge very well.\n",
